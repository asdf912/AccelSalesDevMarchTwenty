Hi {!Case.Contact}, 
 We wanted to know how it&apos;s going since we worked with you to resolve {!Case.CaseNumber}. We&apos;ve prepared a short survey that you can fill out to share your thoughts with us. Your answers will help us serve you better in the future, and it will only take a few minutes to complete the survey. 

Cheers,
